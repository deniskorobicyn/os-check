Linux
1) Polikit autorization
2) in runtime all sudo update-grub, sudo sed /etc/grub/cfg/... etc
Windows, Mac rEFI,
I should read about it, before deside what to do
Windows loader(between windows)
also manageble, maybe more ease then linux, but i doubt it
Most hardest task
Understand how system booting, with what, and how manage it
Espesially in Windows, when dealing with grub and win-loader chained together.
